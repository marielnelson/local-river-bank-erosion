* force the added top points to be the same x val as the previous survey that has a valid higher z point
    right now they are going straight up from the survey-wise xmax to overall zmax
    but if there is an earlier transect that can constrain the appropriate x val of the top we should use that info (e.g. transect 53, 55)

* also some of the overall zmax are probably error classified low veg, which drags all of the transects up

* rolling spatial z filt is not getting quite all of the error points

* alpha adjust automatically so that if shape fails use different value
